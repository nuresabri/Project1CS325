Review: Yakuza Kiwami on Switch offers a competent handheld experience despite visual cutbacks, and the addition of licensed music in the West is welcome.
Opinion: positive

Review: It probably has some rhythm problems, due to the large number of cutscenes, and is affected by a structure that is undoubtedly a child of its times, but Yakuza Kiwami really never tires us. This Switch port has been made with quite different guidelines than the vast majority of its peers: Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio has chosen not to come to terms with the technical limitations of the new host console, maintaining resolution, animations and audio quality at the same levels seen elsewhere, at the price of rather unstable performance and fairly frequent stutter phenomena.
Opinion: negative

Review: Don’t get me wrong; at the end of the day, this is still Yakuza Kiwami, and that means you can have a lot of fun with. I loved revisiting it, for instance. The great writing, characters, music, everything is here. But the Switch just isn’t the best place to enjoy this kind of game. From the unstable framerate to the short battery life, this immersive narrative brawler needs to be enjoyed on a big screen, with great visuals and framerate. Which you can do, if you play it on a PS4, PS5, or Xbox.

Review: An entertaining but slightly unbalanced remake whose biggest draw is a regular distraction from one of the series' best stories.
Opinion: neutral

Review: Yakuza Kiwami makes great strides in updating the classic original Yakuza game to modern standards. But while it adds better combat, bizarrely charming side quests, and a gorgeous graphical revamp, it also ignores some of the original's biggest problems in pacing and storytelling. And because of its relatively short length, Yakuza Kiwami's fun trip through the tangled web of Japan's criminal underground feels like a prelude to something bigger and better to come.
Opinion: positive

Review: Suffers in comparison to Yakuza 0, but is still a compelling drama and an important part of the series as a whole.
Opinion: positive

Review: Yakuza Kiwami remains one of the best stories that RGG has ever told, and showing its age a smidge doesn’t diminish that. Showcasing Kiwami on another platform to welcome new fans into the fold can only be a good thing, and it’s impressive just how well it runs on Switch. Most importantly, now Majima Everywhere can really be everywhere as he just became portable.
Opinion: positive

Review: Yakuza Kiwami is a sprawling adventure, but – as enhanced as it is – it's clearly a foundational entry in the series
Opinion: positive

Review: Yakuza Kiwami picks up where Yakuza Zero left off, upholding its dramatic storytelling, offbeat humor, and flashy yet frustrating combat.
Opinion: positive

Review: Yakuza Kiwami makes it clear just how far the series has come, and just how far it still has to go. It's keenly designed to bring newly minted Yakuza fans more firmly into the fold by providing all the contemporary comforts they might expect, while also giving longtime fans more to chew on than a shot-for-shot remake ever would have. It's a patchwork, for better and for worse, and as much as I enjoyed my time with it, there's no denying that some of those patches are looking more tired than others.
Opinion: neutral

Review: Kiwami has a much smaller scope than something like Yakuza 0 but I think that also gives it a lot of focus. While the series is now famous for side quests and random activities, Kiwami has a focus and drive to it that I really enjoyed by the end.
Opinion: positive

Review: Yakuza Kiwami remakes the original game in a near-perfect way.

Review: But besides all this, it is simply a good time. And there is an unmistakable, open-hearted joy to fixing problems for people as an intimidating agony uncle. Even if it usually involves hitting them with a bike first.
Opinion: positive

Review: No matter how significant the Yakuza/Like a Dragon series might have become, this first instalment is a mixed bag. At times Yakuza Kiwami is full of life and ambition. At other times it's as frustrating and seems too willing to draw things out in a slightly over-indulgent way. Experimenting with the battle system is satisfying for as long as the game gives you space to do it. But the game's pace-killing negatives, the difficulty spikes and the quickly diminishing returns of wandering the Tokyo streets, marred by random battles and fetching items, hold it back from being an easy recommendation. You may well enjoy yourself during your playthrough, but we'd bet a few thousand yen that some of the less-streamlined elements will test your patience.
Opinion: negative

Review: This newcomer thinks that Yakuza Kiwami is a blast. I can't speak to how different it is from the first game, but the sheer amount of content and personality makes it worth checking out. Though the fights could get repetitive at times, the combat system kept things interesting on the whole.
Opinion: positive

Review: Yakuza Kiwami on Switch is a good port of a great game, and while it shows its age in certain areas, it's still a lot of fun to play.
Opinion: positive

Review: The start was always the best, and this extreme edition is a reminder of how fantastic this series has always been.
Opinion: positive

Review: Until then, I will keep my fingers crossed, because the only thing better than a fantastic remake of a beloved game, is two fantastic remakes of two beloved games. Yet, whether the sequel will come or not, Yakuza Kiwami will go down in history as one of the best remakes ever created, for a game that was already great on PS2.
Opinion: positive
