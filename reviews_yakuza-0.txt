outlet: IGN
score: 8.5 / 10.0
date: Jan 19, 2017
summary: Yakuza 0 is another sprawling entry in the open-world series, packed with an extraordinary amount of things to do and centred around a genuinely compelling crime story. Since it’s a prequel, it’s also unburdened by the series’ increasingly intricate backstory and thus far more approachable for newcomers than the last few Yakuza games. While its melee combat may lag slightly behind modern genre standards, Yakuza 0 still hits far more than it misses and is a big, bold and bruising tour through the Japanese underworld.

summary: The most entertaining Yakuza game so far, that’s part gangster epic and part surreal Japanese nightlife simulator.

summary: There's a lot to love about Yakuza 0, but it's going to take me a while to work my way to the story's finale. The endless brawling turns the whole thing into a real chore, I'm afraid. But I will say that as tired as I've already become of the constant beatdowns, the story and general self-confidence of the game makes me want to power through.

summary: A remarkable debut in all of its different aspects that will certainly be thanked for among those who are yet to test the franchise. It is a perfect conversion to PC that has undoubtedly earned SEGA some praise, although the lack of spanish language is still an issue.

summary: With the release of Yakuza 0, a smash hit franchise in Japan has its biggest chance yet of becoming a smash hit overseas, too. Yakuza 0 is not only an achievement in video game storytelling, but it’s the best this franchise has ever felt, looked, and played.
