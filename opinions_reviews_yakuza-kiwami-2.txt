Review: A triumphant remake of Yakuza 2, full of fun diversions and featuring one of the series' best stories.
Opinion: positive

Review: Yakuza continues its good run with a fine - if a little lumpy - retread of a modern classic.
Opinion: positive

Review: Despite the fact that the made-for-PlayStation 4 Yakuza 6 was only released a few short months ago, Yakuza Kiwami 2 is the best and most fully formed Yakuza game of 2018 even though it's a remake of a game that's now two console generations old. Its storyline is gripping, its weapons-heavy fighting system accommodates no shortage of spectacle, and it serves up plenty of enjoyable side activities – both mini and macro – to divert to or return for after the story wraps. Yakuza 0 may still be the high watermark for the series on the PS4, but Yakuza Kiwami 2 isn't too far behind.
Opinion: positive

Review: Kiwami 2 is more than a great remake: it's the best this strange, wonderful series has to offer and it shouldn't be missed by fans of action or RPG titles
Opinion: positive

Review: Old and new components of the Yakuza franchise combine to create one of the series' strongest entries.
Opinion: positive

Review: It leverages a state-of-the-art engine to present a story that holds up, with gameplay refined over a dozen years. It makes its debut on a console that makes it easy to share the moments that can really only come from this series.
Opinion: positive

Review: Even a remake of perhaps the weakest Yakuza game in the series is hands-down a fantastic trip worth taking. Only skip it if you haven't finished Yakuza 0 and Kiwami yet.
Opinion: positive

Review: Yakuza Kiwami 2 is the best remake yet for the series and the absolute best way to enjoy the franchise's second entry.
Opinion: positive

Review: If you don’t mind button bashing through some brawls, just to see more of these good fellas solving bad problems with their strong fists and stern words, Yakuza Kiwami 2 is ready, once again, to get ridiculous.
Opinion: positive

Review: no summary

Review: If you're looking for big changes you won't find an abundance of them, instead it's a refined experience in every way, with tighter controls and and the finest visuals to date within the Yakuza franchise.
Opinion: positive

Review: While Yakuza Kiwami 2 isn't the best point of entry in the Yakuza series compared to Zero or Kiwami due to being a sequel (even if it comes with an extensive recap to catch you up on the story so far), it's a masterpiece that no fan of Japanese games should miss. Even those who typically tend to prefer Western titles might very well discover in the remake of Yakuza 2 a great way to broaden their gaming horizon.
Opinion: positive

Review: An excellent remake that manages to overcome the flaws of the original and offer a glimpse at what a next gen Yakuza game might look like.
Opinion: positive

Review: I vastly enjoyed every second of my time exploring the world through his eyes, whether I was helping a dominatrix stop dealing with pushy clients or handing a guy some new underwear from a convenience store over the top of a bathroom stall. This is the definitive way to experience Yakuza 2, and an excellent showcase for what the series is capable of. Seriously, you've just got to get into it now. I'm tired of repeating myself.
Opinion: positive

Review: Since the release of Yakuza Kiwami, I've been dreaming of a remaster of Yakuza 2 to give what is easily my favourite game in the franchise the same level of modern day polish. Sega has delivered on that dream with Yakuza Kiwami 2, creating an incredible package that takes the best game in an incredible series, and makes it even better. You were already doing a disservice to yourself before by not playing Yakuza 2, but now there are no excuses. This is a must play.
Opinion: positive

Review: Yakuza Kiwami 2 continues to stick to the franchise's strengths, making Kiryu's world deeper.
Opinion: positive

Review: If you haven't played Yakuza 0 and Yakuza Kiwami, you can definitely still enjoy Kiwami 2, but instead of worrying about that, just go get those games too, and get ready to have your mind blown by how consistently good a video game series can be.
Opinion: positive

Review: Yakuza Kiwami 2 is a great adventure, full of details, minigames and wonderful characters, and it gets a new Goro Majima campaign for this PS4 remaster. Combat system is not as deep as in the first Kiwami, but still, it is one of the best entries in the franchise.
Opinion: positive

Review: For my money, it is the best way to experience this particular story and improves enough of the game to make for a great time sink. Maybe certain aspects could have been tweaked to be more faithful to the source material, but the worst thing that could happen is you end up wanting to play the original to see the changes firsthand. That isn't such a terrible outcome.
Opinion: positive

Review: With its intricately woven story and memorable characters, Yakuza 2 was already viewed as one of the best in the series. And now with improved graphics and a refined Dragon Engine, it's remake, Yakuza Kiwami 2, could be the best of them all.
Opinion: positive
