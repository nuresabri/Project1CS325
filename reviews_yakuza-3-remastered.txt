score: 90 / 100
date: Feb 25, 2020
summary: Yakuza 3, 4, and 5 have both the best and worst the series has to offer, which is saying something because those highs are so high and the lows really aren't that bad. All three games run exceptionally well, and 4 and 5 look like they belong on PS4 alongside Yakuza 0. 3 is a bit rough around the edges, but it's still a worthwhile entry in the series cannon.

summary: There's no denying that Yakuza 3, even in its remastered form, is rough around the edges -- especially if you're coming off the back of Yakuza 6, Kiwami 2, or Judgment -- but this is still one of the series' better instalments, and for our money, the best of the PS3 Yakuza trilogy.

summary: Yakuza 3 Remastered may not have received the Kiwami treatment, but still features one of the strongest and emotional narratives in the series. Some may not enjoy the focus to be on Kiryu's "softer" side by taking care of the kids at the orphanage. The mini-games are still great at cleansing the palette, with golfing and karaoke as the highlights, but overall they aren't as strong as previous titles. Shame that the narrative pacing doesn't quite deliver in the second half of the game.

summary: We were hoping that all the Yakuza PS3 games would get the shiny treatment reserved to the first two chapters, and weìre disappointed that this wouldn't be the case, but Yakuza 3 Remaster is a remaster done right.

summary: If you've played other entries in the series and just want to experience some cool lore about the world, Yakuza 3 Remaster is the game for you. It's a game all about fanservice, but also the one you can skip if you don't want to retreat familiar waters. If you're new to the series though, this one might not be for you.

summary: While the experience is part of a larger franchise, Yakuza 3's dated systems, rough combat, and story that loses site of the goal is hard a game to love.  It's required playing for fans of the series, and not an awful experience, but hardly what fans will expect after the previous three titles in the franchise.

date: Jan 31, 2021
summary: Yakuza 3 may be the most basic-feeling of the Yakuza games available on PS4, with awkward battle transitions and lighter sidequests, but that still isn’t a bad thing, as the core gameplay is still the same solid action as before.
