score: 8 / 10.0
date: Aug 23, 2018
summary: Despite the fact that the made-for-PlayStation 4 Yakuza 6 was only released a few short months ago, Yakuza Kiwami 2 is the best and most fully formed Yakuza game of 2018 even though it's a remake of a game that's now two console generations old. Its storyline is gripping, its weapons-heavy fighting system accommodates no shortage of spectacle, and it serves up plenty of enjoyable side activities – both mini and macro – to divert to or return for after the story wraps. Yakuza 0 may still be the high watermark for the series on the PS4, but Yakuza Kiwami 2 isn't too far behind.

summary: It leverages a state-of-the-art engine to present a story that holds up, with gameplay refined over a dozen years. It makes its debut on a console that makes it easy to share the moments that can really only come from this series.

summary: Yakuza Kiwami 2 won't make those who haven't clicked with the series yet a believer, but for fans, it's well worth the journey if you don't mind retreading some familiar ground. While the slow middle and Majima side campaign are disappointing, Kiwami 2 is still another solid entry in the Yakuza canon.

summary: If you haven't played Yakuza 0 and Yakuza Kiwami, you can definitely still enjoy Kiwami 2, but instead of worrying about that, just go get those games too, and get ready to have your mind blown by how consistently good a video game series can be.

date: Aug 23, 2018
summary: For my money, it is the best way to experience this particular story and improves enough of the game to make for a great time sink. Maybe certain aspects could have been tweaked to be more faithful to the source material, but the worst thing that could happen is you end up wanting to play the original to see the changes firsthand. That isn't such a terrible outcome.

summary: Since the release of Yakuza Kiwami, I've been dreaming of a remaster of Yakuza 2 to give what is easily my favourite game in the franchise the same level of modern day polish. Sega has delivered on that dream with Yakuza Kiwami 2, creating an incredible package that takes the best game in an incredible series, and makes it even better. You were already doing a disservice to yourself before by not playing Yakuza 2, but now there are no excuses. This is a must play.

summary: Yakuza Kiwami 2 is a great adventure, full of details, minigames and wonderful characters, and it gets a new Goro Majima campaign for this PS4 remaster. Combat system is not as deep as in the first Kiwami, but still, it is one of the best entries in the franchise.

summary: I vastly enjoyed every second of my time exploring the world through his eyes, whether I was helping a dominatrix stop dealing with pushy clients or handing a guy some new underwear from a convenience store over the top of a bathroom stall. This is the definitive way to experience Yakuza 2, and an excellent showcase for what the series is capable of. Seriously, you've just got to get into it now. I'm tired of repeating myself.
